## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Sass
- Material UI

### What I learned

For this challenge i got to work with Accordions, which are a type of menu that displays a list of items, when you click on them they will either show or hide those items. Personally i've never worked with team before so it was very fun and entertaining to learn and understand how they work.

### Continued development

I would like to continue to learn about accordions, since this is my first time working with them i would like to learn how to customize them to make them look better.

### Useful resources

- [Accordions](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-accordion/) - The official MUI documentation about Accordions, this helped me create the accordions.
